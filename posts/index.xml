      <description>I wanted to do a quick post about the blogging setup I&amp;rsquo;m using, and why I chose it. The purpose of this blog is to provide a place to do write-ups on topics of interest I run across in my work, and share them with the community. Github Pages seemed like a natural (and inexpensive!) hosting solution, given the target audience.
While I was researching hosting, the topic of static site generators came up.</description>

      <description>One of the things DBAs coming from other database systems (like Oracle) need to be aware of when coming to Postgres is how Postgres manages changed data. This is covered in depth in a lot of other places, so I won&amp;rsquo;t repeat in too much detail. The short version is that when a row is updated or deleted, Postgres maintains the old version of that row within the table data file.</description>

      <description>So this is an experiment. I&amp;rsquo;ve never tried to do a blog before, and we&amp;rsquo;re going to see how it goes.
I&amp;rsquo;ve worked in tech a lot of years now. Every so often you come across an interesting problem or learn something new, and I&amp;rsquo;ve often thought it would be nice to have a place to write it up and share it with others. So that&amp;rsquo;s what I aim for this page to be.</description>
